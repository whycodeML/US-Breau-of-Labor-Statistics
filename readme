I have pulled this data directly from the given website using their API. 
Data read in JSON format, providing a way to download data in text form for normal understanding. 
Later, data read in JSON format is converted into appropriate pandas Data Frame. 
This data is currently available for every month and we need unemployment rate for each year, so we have to the average. 
For calculation required data conversions have been performed and data is finally prepared. 
In the end we have exported data into US Unemployment Rate.xlsx with two separate sheets having monthly and yearly data, respectively.
